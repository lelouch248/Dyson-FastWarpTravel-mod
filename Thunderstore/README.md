## Brief Description generated by ChatGPT
In Dyson Sphere Program, fast travel is accomplished by using the "Wormhole Generator" technology. This technology allows players to instantly travel to any planet or celestial body that they have previously visited. To use the Wormhole Generator, players must first research the technology and then build a Wormhole Generator on their current planet. Once the Wormhole Generator is built, players can access a map of the galaxy and select any planet or celestial body that they have previously visited to instantly travel there.

Keep in mind that the Wormhole Generator technology becomes available relatively late in the game, so players will need to progress through the game and unlock new technologies before they can access this feature.
